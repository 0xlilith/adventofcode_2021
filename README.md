## My Advent Of Code 2021 solutions in C++

`AOC Site` : https://adventofcode.com/

Folders are named based on the Day and its respective parts [eg. Day1-part2] <br>
Each folder contains three files :
- `README.md` - Explaination of the problem with the solution to find.
- `input.txt` - Data needed to solve the problem.
- `soln.cpp`  - My solution for that particular problem.

### _Note : The best way to enjoy this repo is by trying out the problem yourself, without consulting my solution._
